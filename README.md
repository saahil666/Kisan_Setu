## 💡 The Problem & The Solution

### The Problem

India has **140+ million farming households**. The vast majority operate smallholder farms — and make critical decisions about irrigation, fertiliser, pest treatment, and when to sell at market with little more than intuition and word of mouth.

The consequences are severe:
- 🦟 **Crop losses of 15–25%** annually from undiagnosed pests and diseases
- 📉 **Missed market windows** because farmers lack real-time mandi (wholesale market) prices
- 🌦️ **Weather-driven failures** from poor access to hyperlocal forecasts
- 🗣️ **Language barriers** — most agri-tech tools are English-only, excluding the very farmers who need them most

The result? A farmer in Solapur with 2 acres of paddy and a wilting leaf cannot tell whether it's bacterial blight or nitrogen deficiency — and may lose half their crop before they find out.

### The Solution

**KisanSetu** (Sanskrit: *किसान सेतु*, literally "Bridge for Farmers") is a full-stack AI platform that puts agronomist-grade intelligence into a farmer's palm — in their own language, optimised for a ₹8,000 Android phone under bright sunlight.

> 💡 **The "Aha!" moment:** A farmer snaps a photo of a diseased leaf, speaks a question in Hindi, and in seconds receives a diagnosis, a treatment plan, the current mandi price for their crop, and a yield forecast — all in one screen, without needing to read English or navigate complex menus.

The key differentiators:
- **Voice-first UX** — designed for low-literacy users; the prominent voice FAB is the primary interaction mode
- **Truly multilingual** — full Hindi and English support with fallback to system fonts for Marathi and Kannada (Noto Sans Devanagari/Kannada)
- **Offline-tolerant design** — critical UI remains functional under poor connectivity
- **100% tested** — 16/16 backend API tests passing at launch

### Technology Choices

| Layer | Technology | Why this choice |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Frontend** | React + Tailwind CSS | Component-based architecture enables rapid iteration; Tailwind's utility classes enforce the strict design system (earthy palette, fat-finger touches, mobile-first containers) without fighting the framework |
| **UI Library** | lucide-react (stroke-width 2.5) | Thick, high-contrast icons remain legible under direct sunlight on low-res screens — critical for the rural-outdoor use case |
| **Typography** | Manrope (headings) + DM Sans (body) | Both are variable fonts with excellent Devanagari fallback support; engineered for high legibility at small sizes on AMOLED/LCD screens in outdoor conditions |
| **Backend** | Python + FastAPI | FastAPI's async architecture handles concurrent AI inference calls without blocking; automatic OpenAPI schema generation makes the API self-documenting |
| **AI Layer** | Vision model + NLP model | Vision model handles multi-class pest/disease classification from raw JPEG/PNG; NLP model generates contextually grounded, crop-specific advice — both abstracted behind a clean `/scan` and `/advisory` API |
| **Testing** | Python `requests` test suite | 16 integration tests covering all endpoints, edge cases (missing image, invalid language), and location-specific data variants — 100% pass rate at deploy |
| **Design System** | Custom JSON (`design_guidelines.json`) | Design tokens are version-controlled alongside code, ensuring frontend engineers and the AI agent share a single source of truth for colours, spacing, and interaction patterns |

## 💻 Usage/Demonstration

### As a Farmer (Web App)

The primary user journey in 4 steps:

```
1. OPEN the app → Dashboard loads instantly with your local weather,
   soil status, and today's mandi prices for 8 crops.

2. TAP the voice FAB (🎙️ the large green button at the bottom) →
   Ask in Hindi: "आज मुझे अपनी फसल में पानी देना चाहिए?"
   ("Should I water my crops today?")
   → Receive a tailored AI advisory in Hindi within seconds.

3. TAP "Pest Scan" → Point your camera at a diseased leaf →
   AI identifies the problem (e.g., "Bacterial Leaf Blight") and
   recommends treatment (e.g., copper-based fungicide, dosage, timing).

4. TAP "Yield Estimate" → Enter crop: Wheat, area: 2 acres →
   Receive an AI-powered harvest and revenue forecast.
```

## 🧠 Challenges Faced & Learnings

### Challenge 1: Designing for Connectivity & Hardware Constraints

**The problem:** The target users — smallholder farmers in Maharashtra and Karnataka — often operate on 2G/3G networks with ₹8,000–₹15,000 entry-level Android devices. Standard React SPAs with lazy-loading and heavy bundles would produce an unacceptable user experience.

**How we solved it:** We enforced a strict performance budget in the design system (`design_guidelines.json`): no glassmorphism (reduces legibility in sunlight), animations capped at 200ms (feels snappy on low-end CPUs), and all interactive targets set to a minimum height of 56px (`min-h-[56px]`) to accommodate imprecise touch inputs. The mobile-first container (`max-w-480px`) was enforced at the layout level, not as a responsive afterthought.

**Learning:** Designing for *constraints* rather than capabilities forced us to make every UI decision intentional — and produced a faster, cleaner product than we would have shipped otherwise.

---

### Challenge 2: Multilingual AI Output at Inference Time

**The problem:** Instructing an LLM to respond in Hindi is straightforward — but ensuring consistent, grammatically correct Devanagari output across diverse crop-specific queries (especially with technical terms like "bacterial blight" or "NPK ratio") required careful prompt engineering. Early versions would code-switch mid-sentence or default to English for technical terminology.

**How we solved it:** We implemented a structured prompt template that provides the AI with (a) the farmer's language preference, (b) the crop context, and (c) explicit instructions to use common Hindi agricultural vocabulary for technical terms, with a glossary of pre-approved substitutions. The `advisory` endpoint's 100% test pass rate — including the "invalid language" edge case gracefully defaulting to Hindi — validates this approach.

**Learning:** Multilingual AI is not just a `lang=hi` flag. It requires language-aware prompt design, test coverage of edge cases (empty queries, unsupported language codes), and a fallback strategy that never leaves the farmer staring at an error.

---

### Challenge 3: Reliable Pest Diagnosis from Consumer-Grade Photos

**The problem:** Crop disease identification requires high-quality, well-lit, correctly framed images — the exact opposite of what a farmer in a field at noon with a shaking hand will produce. Early tests showed the vision model struggling with overexposed, blurry, or partial-leaf images.

**How we solved it:** We implemented image pre-processing on the client side (contrast normalisation, centre-crop to focus on the affected region) before base64 encoding and sending to `/scan`. We also added a graceful 422 error for missing images and ensured the test suite validates this failure mode explicitly.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

| Priority | Feature | Impact |
|----------|---------|--------|
| 🥇 **High** | **Offline-first PWA with local model caching** — download a compact TFLite pest classification model to the device so basic scans work without internet | Removes the single biggest barrier for farmers in areas with no signal |
| 🥈 **High** | **Community Alert Network** — crowdsource pest outbreak data; when 3+ farmers in a district report the same issue, auto-generate a region-wide alert | Turns individual data points into collective intelligence |
| 🥉 **Medium** | **Vernacular voice input for Marathi & Kannada** — extend speech-to-text beyond Hindi/English to Maharashtra's dominant regional language | Reaches an additional 83 million Marathi-speaking farmers |
| 🔬 **Medium** | **Soil health history tracking** — store NDVI and soil moisture readings over time per farm, enabling trend analysis and predictive irrigation scheduling | Moves the product from reactive to proactive farming guidance |
